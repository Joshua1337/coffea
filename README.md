## WIP / Unstable

This is a work in progress. It may be unstable and the branch build might be failing (this branch: [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/caffeinery/coffea/0.6.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/caffeinery/coffea)). We plan to update the README with docs as we progress through this re-write so if you're curious to try somthing super crazy unstable, you can, provided you're aware we're not responsible if this WIP version of coffea kills your cat.
